# Backup Script

Simple PowerShell scripts to back up a notes folder (in my case notes taken in Obsidian) to a ZIP file and send an email with the backup status.

Designed to run automatically (monthly) using Windows Task Scheduler.

---

## Setup

### 1. Create SMTP credentials (required)

Run the credential script **once**.  
This stores your email credentials encrypted for your Windows user.

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File create-smtp-credentials.ps1
```

This will prompt for:

- Email address
- Email password (or app password)

It creates an encrypted credential file

### 2. Create config file

Copy the example config:

config.example.json -> config.json


Edit config.json and set the variables.

### 3. Run backup manually
```powershell
powershell.exe `
  -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File backup.ps1 `
  -ConfigPath "C:\path\to\config.json"
```

### Scheduling

Use Windows Task Scheduler to run the backup script on the 1st of every month.

Program:

powershell.exe


Arguments:

-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File backup-notes.ps1 -ConfigPath "C:\path\to\config.json"


Run as the same Windows user that created the SMTP credentials.

# Notes

Backups are ZIP files with date in the filename

Email is sent on success and on failure

If you want to use it for **Gmail** and have 2 factor authentication enabled, you should generate an app password and use that password instead!

# Testing Manually
With an example folder `C:\Repositories\NotesBackup`
1. open powershell
2. cd "C:\Repositories\NotesBackup"
3. run
```
powershell.exe `
  -ExecutionPolicy Bypass `
  -File .\backup-notes.ps1 `
  -ConfigPath "C:\Repositories\NotesBackup\config.json"
  ```
